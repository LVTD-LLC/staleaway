# Staleaway Design

## Overview

Staleaway should feel like a quiet maintenance console for people responsible for keeping websites current. The design language is calm, crisp, and practical: high-contrast ink, restrained green accents, thin borders, compact data surfaces, and no generic SaaS spectacle.

Marketing screens should show the review loop immediately: sitemap import, due pages, client grouping, email digest, and one-click review. Authenticated app screens should be task-first and scannable, with visual emphasis reserved for the next useful action.

## Colors

The implementation source of truth is `frontend/src/styles/index.css`, where the `--pf-*` variables use OKLCH values. Keep DESIGN.md and those CSS tokens aligned when changing brand or product UI colors.

- `primary` / `--pf-brand-dark`: primary actions, active links, and durable brand marks.
- `primary-hover` / `--pf-ink`: dark hover states for primary actions.
- `secondary` / `--pf-brand`: lighter orientation accents and focus rings.
- `primary-soft` / `--pf-brand-soft`: low-pressure status badges and gentle highlight backgrounds.
- `on-primary`: white text on dark action surfaces; it matches `oklch(1 0 0)`.
- `text` / `--pf-ink`: headings and primary body text.
- `text-muted` / `--pf-muted`: helper text, secondary copy, and captions.
- `text-subtle` / `--pf-subtle`: low-emphasis metadata and inactive states.
- `background` / `--pf-surface`: page background.
- `surface` / `--pf-panel`: white panels and inputs.
- `surface-muted` / `--pf-panel-muted`: tinted panels, hover rows, and quiet empty states.
- `border` / `--pf-line`: dividers, panel outlines, and input borders.
- `warning` / `--pf-warning`: billing limits and caution indicators.
- `warning-soft`, `warning-line`, `warning-ink`: warning banners and caution actions.
- `danger` / `--pf-danger`: destructive/archive actions and real error states.
- `danger-soft`, `danger-line`, `danger-hover`: destructive action hover, border, and filled-button states.

Do not introduce a second dominant accent color. If a new state is needed, derive it from the existing semantic colors and verify contrast.

Email templates use the documented `email-*` hex fallbacks because many email clients do not reliably support CSS custom properties or OKLCH. Keep those fallbacks visually aligned with the `--pf-*` tokens when the product palette changes. Use `email-muted` for small footer copy on `email-surface-muted`; reserve `email-subtle` for larger secondary copy on light email surfaces. Long literal strings such as copy-paste URLs, sitemap URLs, client labels, page titles, and paths need inline wrapping styles so narrow email clients do not overflow.

## Typography

Use the system font stack everywhere. This keeps the app fast, familiar, and utilitarian. Headings are semibold, body text is regular, and labels use semibold weight. Letter spacing stays at `0`; do not use tight negative tracking or all-caps dashboard labels unless the surrounding UI already does.

Marketing pages may use larger display sizes, but product panels should stay compact. Inside cards, tables, modals, forms, and navigation, prefer small headings and strong labels over hero-scale type.

## Layout

Use `pf-shell` as the default page width container. Product screens should prioritize repeated work: filters near lists, row actions close to URLs, settings grouped by sitemap, and plan usage visible without becoming the page.

Marketing pages should reveal the product artifact in the first viewport and leave a hint of the next section visible. Avoid split-layout hero pages where the product is hidden in a decorative card; the review queue, digest, or dashboard itself should carry the story.

Use stable dimensions for toolbars, tables, icon buttons, counters, and repeated rows so dynamic content does not shift the layout. Long URLs must wrap cleanly and never overflow their container.

## Elevation & Depth

Staleaway is mostly flat. Convey hierarchy with borders, spacing, muted surfaces, and typography rather than heavy shadows. Panels should use a 1px border with `--pf-line`; tinted panels should use `--pf-panel-muted`.

Use shadows only for overlays, dropdowns, or modals where depth clarifies focus. Do not stack cards inside cards.

## Shapes

The shape language is soft but efficient:

- Standard buttons and inputs: 12px radius.
- Panels and major grouped surfaces: 16px radius.
- Small tags and status pills: full radius.
- Avoid oversized pill buttons for normal product actions.

Keep repeated components consistent. Do not introduce new radii unless the existing `rounded` tokens cannot express the state.

## Components

Use existing `pf-*` classes before adding new component styles.

- Primary buttons: one clear next action per surface, green/ink hover, visible focus ring.
- Secondary buttons: bordered white controls for cancel, filter, navigation, and low-risk actions.
- Warning and danger controls: use `pf-warning-*` and `pf-danger-*` classes rather than raw Tailwind amber/red utilities.
- Inputs: `pf-input` with visible labels and helper text where the expected value is not obvious.
- Badges: client labels, plan/status metadata, and compact classifications.
- Panels: individual tools, lists, forms, and modals only. Page sections should not become nested card stacks.
- Tables/lists: URLs are the core data. Keep URL text readable, row actions nearby, and status columns compact.

Destructive actions should use red text/background treatment and clear labels such as `Archive`, never vague icon-only controls.

## Motion

Marketing pages can use short entrance and hover motion when it clarifies the product artifact. Product UI motion should stay between 150 and 250ms, be tied to state changes, and avoid drawing attention away from review work.

All motion must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Do not add decorative looping animation, parallax, or animated background effects.

## Do's and Don'ts

Do:

- Show the maintenance loop clearly.
- Keep dashboard and settings screens dense enough for repeated use.
- Use the Staleaway green for actions, state, and orientation.
- Preserve keyboard focus, readable labels, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Match new templates to the existing `pf-*` component vocabulary.

Don't:

- Build generic SaaS hero sections, decorative icon-card grids, or blue-template dashboards.
- Add decorative blobs, bokeh, heavy gradients, or motion that distracts from maintenance work.
- Use AI/generative imagery when the user needs to inspect actual product state.
- Hide core sitemap, client, queue, digest, billing, or review information behind marketing copy.
- Let long URLs, email addresses, or client labels overflow controls or table cells.
